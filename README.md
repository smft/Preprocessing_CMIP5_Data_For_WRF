# Preprocessing_CMIP5_Data_For_WRF
Interpolate CMIP5 upper level Data to ERA-Interim vertical levels and horizontal grid (generated by WPS). By modifying the met_em files generated by metgrid.exe in WPS with the new generated already interpolated data, you can drive your WRF.exe with the CMIP5 Datasets.

Horzontal interpolation is using the bilinear method and vertical interpolation is using the cubic spline method.
